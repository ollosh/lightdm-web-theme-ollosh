## Ollosh's web-greeter lightdm theme

![ollosh-theme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12979324/215791215-97803574-c3ce-4ade-9bc1-6ca062f525b1.gif)

Made to work with [nody-greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/nody-greeter) this simple theme was fully customized to fit my DE setup. It's replicating polybar on the bottom and rofi power menu. 

The main goal of the theme was to keep things simple. Everything is basically configured in 4 main files at the top-level. Therefore, there is not much customization possible. Both brightness and battery are working out of the box so make sure to have the greeter properly customized. 

### Background image
Since I'm using a customized tool to change the wallpaper, it's convenient for me to store the image in `/usr/share/background/ollosh/background.jpg`. That is the place where background image of choice should be placed.
